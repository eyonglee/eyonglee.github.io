        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hello! My name is Ethan Lee and I'm a passionate junior at the University of Michigan, where I'm diving deep into the world of computer science and software engineering. My journey in this dynamic and ever-evolving domain is not just an academic pursuit; it's a pathway to innovating and contributing to the tech world. Balancing my technical aspirations with a love for music and an active lifestyle, I embody a blend of analytical acumen and creative expression.</p>

<p>At the University of Michigan, my academic journey in computer science is driven by a passion for practical innovation. Beyond mastering the complexities of algorithms and programming languages, I focus on applying these skills in impactful ways. A highlight of my project portfolio includes creating an Instagram clone, which involved using a real database to manage dynamic content and user interactions. This project not only honed my coding skills but also deepened my understanding of modern app development. Additionally, I developed a search engine using an intuitive page rank system, which allowed me to delve into the intricacies of data sorting and retrieval. These projects exemplify my ambition to become a tech innovator, combining technical prowess with a flair for creative problem-solving.</p>

<p>Music is a cornerstone of my life, harmonizing perfectly with my academic endeavors. As a dedicated trumpet player, I've had the privilege of being both a performer and a leader. In the Michigan Marching Band, I hold the esteemed role of rank leader, a position that has allowed me to develop strong leadership skills and foster a sense of unity and discipline among my peers. My musical journey extends beyond the marching band; I am also a conductor and active member of a trumpet ensemble. This role not only showcases my musical talent but also demonstrates my ability to guide and inspire fellow musicians. Through these experiences, I have learned the art of balancing individual performance with the synergy of teamwork.</p>

<p>
    An active lifestyle is not just a choice for me; it's a way of life. My early years were marked by a strong involvement in cross country and track, instilling in me the values of endurance and discipline. These sports taught me the importance of perseverance and setting goals, traits that I carry into all aspects of my life.
    My love for the outdoors continues to thrive. Whether it's lifting weights at the gym, playing a vigorous game of flag football, or shooting hoops on the basketball court, I find that staying physically active is crucial for maintaining a balanced and healthy lifestyle. These activities are not only a means to physical fitness but also provide a great way to connect with others and unwind from the rigors of academic life.
    In quieter moments, I enjoy delving into the world of video games, which offers a different kind of challenge and relaxation. Gaming allows me to engage in strategic thinking and immerse myself in diverse virtual landscapes, providing a perfect balance to my physically active pursuits.
</p>

<p>As I navigate through my multifaceted life as a student, musician, and athlete, the common threads of leadership and ambition weave through each aspect. These experiences have not only shaped my skills but also my character, defining me as a leader who thrives on challenges and strives for excellence. Whether it's leading a section in the marching band, spearheading a project in computer science, or collaborating on the sports field, my goal is always to inspire and uplift those around me. I invite you to explore these dimensions of my life further and see how my unique blend of talents and drive can contribute to your endeavors.</p>
